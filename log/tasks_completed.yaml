    name: Add phase 0
    goal: Add a phase 0 to the main specification document (./spec/spec.yaml); it
      needs to outline any steps to prepare for phase 1 development.

    summary: 'Successfully added phase 0 to the specification with comprehensive

      preparation and bootstrapping steps. Created placeholder manual files

      for system and user documentation. Implemented a verification script

      to check spec file references and ensure consistency.


      Phase 0 defines concrete steps for:

      - Project folder structure creation

      - Node.js and Python initialization

      - Development environment configuration

      - Testing infrastructure setup

      - Documentation templates

      - Git repository initialization

      - Specification verification tooling

    summary: 'Successfully created tooling and tasks for Phase 0 implementation.


      Created a Python-based document query tool (doc_query.py) that provides

      contextual retrieval from specifications, logs, and todos. The tool supports

      multiple query modes: text search, key search, file content retrieval, and

      related files discovery with relevance scoring.


      Developed a comprehensive test suite (test_doc_query.py) with 6 tests covering

      all functionality. All tests pass successfully.


      Created 8 detailed LLM prompt files (prompt_0_2_1.md through prompt_0_2_9.md)

      for each Phase 0 step. Each prompt includes:

      - Context gathering instructions using doc_query tool

      - Specific requirements and dependencies

      - Step-by-step implementation instructions

      - Expected outputs and deliverables

      - Verification steps


      Added tasks 0.2-0.9 to master_todo.yaml for systematic Phase 0 implementation.

      Each task corresponds to a prompt file and has clear goals and verification
      steps.
