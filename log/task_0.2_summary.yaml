task_id: 0.2
task_name: Create Root Project Structure
completed_at: 2024-01-09T00:00:00Z
status: completed

summary: |
  Successfully created the root project folder structure for the oinkerui application.
  All directories, .gitkeep files, and README.md files have been created as specified.

steps_completed:
  - step: 1
    action: Gathered context from specifications
    details: |
      Retrieved phase 0 details, domain information, and configuration details
      using the doc_query tool to understand project requirements.
    justification: |
      Understanding the project structure requirements from specifications ensures
      the directory structure aligns with the domain model and configuration.

  - step: 2
    action: Created directory structure
    details: |
      Created all required directories:
      - frontend/ (with src/, public/, tests/)
      - backend/ (with src/, tests/, tools/)
      - docs/ (with architecture/, api/, user/)
      - scripts/
      - tests/
      - .github/workflows/
    justification: |
      This structure supports both local development (Phase 1-3) and server
      deployment (Phase 4+) as specified in the requirements.

  - step: 3
    action: Added .gitkeep files
    details: |
      Added .gitkeep files to all empty directories to ensure they are tracked by Git:
      - frontend/public/.gitkeep
      - frontend/tests/.gitkeep
      - backend/tests/.gitkeep
      - backend/tools/.gitkeep
      - docs/architecture/.gitkeep
      - docs/api/.gitkeep
      - docs/user/.gitkeep
      - scripts/.gitkeep
      - tests/.gitkeep
      - .github/workflows/.gitkeep
    justification: |
      Git does not track empty directories. .gitkeep files ensure the directory
      structure is preserved in version control.

  - step: 4
    action: Created README.md files
    details: |
      Created comprehensive README.md files for major directories:
      - frontend/README.md - Describes Svelte frontend structure and development
      - backend/README.md - Describes FastAPI backend structure and APIs
      - docs/README.md - Describes documentation organization
      - scripts/README.md - Describes build and utility scripts
    justification: |
      README files provide clear documentation for each directory's purpose,
      making it easier for developers to understand the project structure.

  - step: 5
    action: Verified directory structure
    details: |
      Ran tree command to verify all directories and files were created correctly.
      Confirmed the structure matches the specification requirements.
    justification: |
      Verification ensures the task was completed correctly and all required
      components are in place.

files_created:
  - frontend/src/
  - frontend/public/
  - frontend/tests/
  - frontend/README.md
  - frontend/public/.gitkeep
  - frontend/tests/.gitkeep
  - backend/src/
  - backend/tests/
  - backend/tools/
  - backend/README.md
  - backend/tests/.gitkeep
  - backend/tools/.gitkeep
  - docs/architecture/
  - docs/api/
  - docs/user/
  - docs/README.md
  - docs/architecture/.gitkeep
  - docs/api/.gitkeep
  - docs/user/.gitkeep
  - scripts/
  - scripts/README.md
  - scripts/.gitkeep
  - tests/
  - tests/.gitkeep
  - .github/workflows/
  - .github/workflows/.gitkeep

verification:
  method: tree command
  result: success
  notes: |
    All directories and files created successfully.
    Structure verified with: tree -L 2 -I '.git|__pycache__' --dirsfirst
    
    Directory structure:
    - frontend/ (Svelte frontend with src/, public/, tests/)
    - backend/ (FastAPI backend with src/, tests/, tools/)
    - docs/ (Documentation with architecture/, api/, user/)
    - scripts/ (Build and utility scripts)
    - tests/ (Integration tests)
    - .github/workflows/ (GitHub workflows)

alignment_with_specs:
  - spec: spec/domain.yaml
    alignment: |
      Directory structure supports the domain entities (Project, Chat, Message, etc.)
      and provides clear separation between frontend and backend components.
  
  - spec: spec/config.yaml
    alignment: |
      Structure supports the workspace configuration and allows for both local
      development and server deployment as specified.
  
  - spec: Phase 0 requirements
    alignment: |
      Completes the first step of Phase 0 preparation by establishing the
      root project folder structure.
