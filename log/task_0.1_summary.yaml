task_id: 0.1
title: "Phase 0 preparation"
date: 2025-01-19
status: complete

summary: |
  Successfully created tooling and tasks for Phase 0 implementation. Created a Python-based
  document query tool for contextual retrieval from specifications, a comprehensive test suite,
  and 8 detailed LLM prompt files for each Phase 0 step. Added tasks 0.2-0.9 to master_todo.yaml
  for systematic Phase 0 implementation.

steps_completed:
  - step: 1
    action: "Create Python document query tool"
    details: "Created tools/doc_query.py with multiple query modes"
    justification: |
      The document query tool is essential for LLMs to retrieve contextual information from
      specifications, logs, and todos. It supports text search, key search, file content
      retrieval, and related files discovery with relevance scoring. This enables LLMs to
      build proper context before executing each Phase 0 task.
    
  - step: 2
    action: "Create test script for doc_query tool"
    details: "Created verify/test_doc_query.py with 6 comprehensive tests"
    justification: |
      Testing ensures the doc_query tool works correctly across all modes. The test suite
      covers text search, key search, file content retrieval, related files, context
      extraction, and error handling. All 6 tests pass successfully, confirming the tool
      is ready for use.
    
  - step: 3
    action: "Run tests and verify tool functionality"
    details: "Executed test suite, all 6 tests passed"
    justification: |
      Verification confirms the tool meets all requirements and handles edge cases properly.
      The tool successfully searches across YAML files, extracts context with proper paths,
      and handles parsing errors gracefully.
    
  - step: 4
    action: "Build LLM prompt files for Phase 0 steps"
    details: "Created 8 prompt files in prompts/dev/ directory"
    justification: |
      Each prompt file provides detailed instructions for a specific Phase 0 step:
      - prompt_0_2_1.md: Create root project structure
      - prompt_0_2_2.md: Initialize Node.js project
      - prompt_0_2_3.md: Initialize Python project
      - prompt_0_2_4.md: Initialize Svelte frontend
      - prompt_0_2_5.md: Create development environment configuration
      - prompt_0_2_6.md: Create build and development scripts
      - prompt_0_2_7.md: Create testing infrastructure
      - prompt_0_2_8.md: Create documentation
      - prompt_0_2_9.md: Initialize Git repository and final verification
      
      Each prompt includes context gathering instructions using the doc_query tool,
      specific requirements, step-by-step instructions, expected outputs, and
      verification steps. This ensures consistent and thorough implementation.
    
  - step: 5
    action: "Create new tasks (0.2-0.9) in master_todo.yaml"
    details: "Added 8 new tasks for Phase 0 implementation"
    justification: |
      Breaking Phase 0 into discrete tasks (0.2-0.9) allows for systematic implementation
      and verification. Each task corresponds to a prompt file and has clear goals, focus
      areas, and verification steps. This structured approach ensures nothing is missed
      and progress can be tracked effectively.
