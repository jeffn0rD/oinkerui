    justification: Standard shell with good process management capabilities
  
  - decision: Created Windows .bat equivalents
    justification: Ensures cross-platform compatibility
  
  - decision: Integrated with npm scripts
    justification: Provides familiar interface for Node.js developers
  
  - decision: Added color-coded output
    justification: Improves readability and user experience
  
  - decision: Implemented graceful shutdown
    justification: Ensures clean process termination and resource cleanup

next_steps:
  - Task 0.8: Create Testing Infrastructure
  - Future: Add production deployment scripts

  - Future: Add CI/CD pipeline scripts

notes: |
  All build and development scripts are complete and ready for use. The scripts provide
  a comprehensive development workflow with support for both Linux/Mac and Windows platforms.
  Developers can easily start all services together or individually, run tests, lint code,
  format code, and clean build artifacts. The integration with npm scripts provides a
  familiar and convenient interface. All scripts include proper error handling and user-
  friendly output messages.
