task_id: "0.3.0"
task_name: "Review and Update Phase 0 Tasks"
status: complete
date_completed: 2024-01-20
execution_time: ~2 hours

summary: |
  Reviewed all Phase 0 tasks (0.3.5 - 0.9) against the expanded specifications
  created in tasks 0.2.5.1-0.2.5.6. Updated all task prompts to reference the
  new module, function, and schema specifications. All prompts now include
  exact dependency versions from module specs and comprehensive implementation
  guidance based on the detailed specifications.

  - Execute task 0.7 (Create Build and Development Scripts)
  - Execute task 0.8 (Create Testing Infrastructure)
  - Execute task 0.9 (Create Documentation and Initialize Git)

notes: |
  The updated prompts provide significantly more detail and guidance than the
  original prompts. They reference the expanded specifications created in the
  0.2.5.x task series, ensuring that implementation will be consistent with
  the detailed system design. All dependency versions are now explicitly
  specified to match the module specifications, preventing version mismatches.
  
  The prompts are ready for execution and should result in a complete,
  well-structured Phase 0 implementation that aligns perfectly with the
  expanded specifications.
