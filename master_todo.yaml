title: oinkerui master todo list
description: 'This is a master development todo list for human and machine interaction.

  '
prompt_guidance: 'Always follow these guidelines and update project documentation:

  **** When possible and practical use deterministic methods (python code) to accomplish tasks.  ****

  * When processing tasks always creae a brief summary of steps and actions in log/task_<id>_summary.yaml .

  * when processing a task review the last task notes (log/task_<id>_notes.yaml).  There may be information needed or remaining
  work that needs to be completed first.

  * In the task_<id>_summary.yaml file always provide ''justification:'' for each step/action.  It is important to track the
  decisions made and reasoning behind them.

  * If there are errors, inconsistencies, or inadequate information to accomplish all goals of a task append questions to
  ./open_questions.yaml

  * If the task is complete mark it complete by removing the task from the list in this document and appending it to ./log/tasks_completed.yaml

  * Tasks should be verified before considered complete, when possible use a small python script (save to ./verify/task_<id>_<descriptor>.py).
  The script should be well commented as to what it does and why.

  * Always make sure system documentation is up to date with work just done! manuals go in ./man/*.yaml

  * NOTE: All spec files need to have consistent references to each other.  This needs to be verified whenever spec files
  are changed.

  **** You can create temporary files to assist with task completion but they should be removed when task is complete.  Use
  the files outlined here for project tracking. ****

  **** It is important to keep the repository clean of uneccessary files. ****

  **** Follow the task instructions closely and carefully.  Constrain work and scope to the task.  Return with questions if
  needed and confirm any extra work if it is outside the scope. ****

  **** ALWAYS COMMIT AND PUSH the repository after a task. ****

current:
- task:
    id: 0.5
    name: Initialize Svelte Frontend
    goal: Set up Svelte frontend with Vite and Tailwind CSS.

      focus:
      - Svelte + Vite setup
      - Tailwind CSS integration
      - Basic component structure
      verification:
      - npm run dev in frontend/
      - npm run build works
- task:
    id: 0.8
    name: Create Testing Infrastructure
    goal: Set up testing infrastructure for frontend (Vitest), Node.js backend (Jest), and Python backend (pytest).
    prompt: ./prompts/dev/prompt_0_8_updated.md
    files:
    - prompts/dev/prompt_0_8_updated.md
    - spec/functions/
    - spec/domain.yaml
    - spec/apis.yaml
    - spec/modules/backend_node.yaml
    - spec/modules/frontend_svelte.yaml
    details:
      focus:
      - Jest configuration for Svelte
      - pytest configuration
      - Example tests
      verification:
      - npm run test:frontend
      - npm run test:backend
      - All tests pass
- task:
    id: 0.9
    name: Create Documentation and Initialize Git
    goal: Create comprehensive documentation and initialize Git repository.
    prompt: ./prompts/dev/prompt_0_9_updated.md
    files:
    - prompts/dev/prompt_0_9_updated.md
    - spec/spec.yaml
    - spec/domain.yaml
    - spec/apis.yaml
    - spec/workflows.yaml
    - spec/modules/
    - spec/functions/
    details:
      focus:
      - README.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, ARCHITECTURE.md
      - API documentation
      - .gitignore and Git setup
      - Phase 0 verification
      - Entities (User, Order, Invoice, Workflow, Task, etc.).
      - Relationships (owns, approves, contains, depends_on, etc.).
      notes:
      - develop mapping to data_models/types.
      steps:
      - Review spec documents and determine details that need to be added for a complete domain model.
      - If more information is needed update ./open_questions.yaml
      - New spec files can be created if appropriate.  Use verification script to verify new files are referenced correctly.
      verification:
      - Run verify/verify_phase_0.py
      - All documentation complete
      - Git repository initialized
future:
- add context re-ordering feature; prompt/responses in chat history can be re-ordered in the left side list, drag and drop
  and/or buttons move up/down.  Need a reset button as well.
- (LLM) crawl the spec files and look for inconsistencies and areas that need elaboration, create document of questions to
  be addressed.
- repository bootstrapping with node/fastapi
