title: oinkerui master todo list
description: 'This is a master development todo list for human and machine interaction.

  '
prompt_guidance: 'Always follow these guidelines and update project documentation:

  **** When possible and practical use deterministic methods (python code) to accomplish tasks.  ****

  * When processing tasks always creae a brief summary of steps and actions in log/task_<id>_summary.yaml .

  * when processing a task review the last task notes (log/task_<id>_notes.yaml).  There may be information needed or remaining
  work that needs to be completed first.

  * In the task_<id>_summary.yaml file always provide ''justification:'' for each step/action.  It is important to track the
  decisions made and reasoning behind them.

  * If there are errors, inconsistencies, or inadequate information to accomplish all goals of a task append questions to
  ./open_questions.yaml

  * If the task is complete mark it complete by removing the task from the list in this document and appending it to ./log/tasks_completed.yaml

  * Tasks should be verified before considered complete, when possible use a small python script (save to ./verify/task_<id>_<descriptor>.py).
  The script should be well commented as to what it does and why.

  * Always make sure system documentation is up to date with work just done! manuals go in ./man/*.yaml

  * NOTE: All spec files need to have consistent references to each other.  This needs to be verified whenever spec files
  are changed.

  **** You can create temporary files to assist with task completion but they should be removed when task is complete.  Use
  the files outlined here for project tracking. ****

  **** It is important to keep the repository clean of uneccessary files. ****

  **** Follow the task instructions closely and carefully.  Constrain work and scope to the task.  Return with questions if
  needed and confirm any extra work if it is outside the scope. ****

  **** ALWAYS COMMIT AND PUSH the repository after a task. ****

- task:
    id: 0.3.0
    name: Review and Update phase 0 tasks
    goal: Specifications have been expanded; review tasks 0.3.5, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9 (phase 0) and update if necessary; tasks should be ready for full phase 0 implementation
    files:

      focus:
      - successful phase 0 task set      
    notes: |
      The specification documents have been considerably expanded to accomodate through phase 2 implementation.  Review each of the remaining 0.* tasks,
      use the doc_query tool to look up relevant specifications (there are new subdirectories spec/functions, spec/modules, spec/schemas); if the task is
      no longer in compliance with the specifications then it should be regenerated.  Make sure to review the prompts associated with each task.

      steps:
      - Review spec documents and determine details that need to be added for a complete domain model.

future:
- add context re-ordering feature; prompt/responses in chat history can be re-ordered in the left side list, drag and drop
  and/or buttons move up/down.  Need a reset button as well.
- (LLM) crawl the spec files and look for inconsistencies and areas that need elaboration, create document of questions to
  be addressed.
- repository bootstrapping with node/fastapi
