prompt_guidance: 'Always follow these guidelines and update project documentation:

  **** When possible and practical use deterministic methods (python code) to accomplish
  tasks.  ****

  * When processing tasks always creae a brief summary of steps and actions in log/task_<id>_summary.yaml
  .

  * when processing a task review the last task notes (log/task_<id>_notes.yaml).  There
  may be information needed or remaining work that needs to be completed first.

  * In the task_<id>_summary.yaml file always provide ''justification:'' for each
  step/action.  It is important to track the decisions made and reasoning behind them.

  * If there are errors, inconsistencies, or inadequate information to accomplish
  all goals of a task append questions to ./open_questions.yaml

  * If the task is complete mark it complete by removing the task from the list in
  this document and appending it to ./log/tasks_completed.yaml

  * Tasks should be verified before considered complete, when possible use a small
  python script (save to ./verify/task_<id>_<descriptor>.py). The script should be
  well commented as to what it does and why.

  * Always make sure system documentation is up to date with work just done! manuals
  go in ./man/*.yaml

  * NOTE: All spec files need to have consistent references to each other.  This needs
  to be verified whenever spec files are changed.

  **** You can create temporary files to assist with task completion but they should
  be removed when task is complete.  Use the files outlined here for project tracking.
  ****

  **** It is important to keep the repository clean of uneccessary files. ****

  **** Follow the task instructions closely and carefully.  Constrain work and scope
  to the task.  Return with questions if needed and confirm any extra work if it is
  outside the scope. ****

  **** ALWAYS COMMIT AND PUSH the repository after a task. ****

- task:
    id: 0.2.5
    name: Specification refinement planning
    goal: Generate a list of prompts to update and refine the specifications to full detail.    
    files:
    - spec/domain.yaml
    - spec/commands.yaml
    - spec/apis.yaml
    - spec/ui.yaml
    - spec/workflows.yaml
    
    details:
      focus:
      - "Domain modeling & vocabulary"
      - "State model & invariants"
      - "Workflows & data flows"
      - "Interaction design (screens / APIs)"
      - "Modules, functions, api endpoints"
      - "Function contracts, inputs, outputs, side effects, and algorithm FOL"
      verification:
      - verify any references in new/modified spec files are valid; graphs for review
      guidance: |
        Existing spec file detail must cover the entire application specification through (at least) phase 2.  New spec files need to be generated
        for module specifications which will encapsulate function details.  Graphs need to be generated for domain/data model, state management, workflows, interaction, modules.
        The files must contain links and references so they can be checked for consistency by deterministic tools.  
        Module specs must clearly outline the module role, its interaction with other parts of the system, what data entities are used and how, interaction with system state,
        and the functions of its implementation.  Functions need to have full contracts defined, inputs, outputs, side effects.  Function algorithms must be defined in first order logic and a complexity rating should be provided to assist with development planning.  Functions and modules should additionally have 'LLM prompt guidance' defined in order to assist an LLM agent with generating the required code.  This information needs to be enough to deterministically create the module and its function prototypes, and then spawn coding agents to complete the function implementation.  
        Output a new set of tasks (at least 6) with corresponding prompts and, for modules/functions/algorithms a schema for the new (yaml) file structures.  Specify how everything will be linked together and verification strategy.  Graphs (mermaid) need to generated for each step as well for human review.
        New tasks should be numbered 0.2.5.n and added to master_todo.yaml
        Split the tasks up so that each step is focused with narrow scope and clear goals / outputs.

future:
- add context re-ordering feature; prompt/responses in chat history can be re-ordered
  in the left side list, drag and drop and/or buttons move up/down.  Need a reset
  button as well.
- (LLM) crawl the spec files and look for inconsistencies and areas that need elaboration,
  create document of questions to be addressed.
- repository bootstrapping with node/fastapi
