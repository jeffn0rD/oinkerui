title: oinkerui master todo list
description: |
  This is a master development todo list for human and machine interaction.
  
prompt_guidance: |
  Always follow these guidelines and update project documentation:
  **** When possible and practical use deterministic methods (python code) to accomplish tasks.  ****
  * When processing tasks always creae a brief summary of steps and actions in log/task_<id>_summary.yaml .
  * when processing a task review the last task notes (log/task_<id>_notes.yaml).  There may be information needed or remaining work that needs to be completed first.
  * In the task_<id>_summary.yaml file always provide 'justification:' for each step/action.  It is important to track the decisions made and reasoning behind them.
  * If there are errors, inconsistencies, or inadequate information to accomplish all goals of a task append questions to ./open_questions.yaml
  * If the task is complete mark it complete by removing the task from the list in this document and appending it to ./log/tasks_completed.yaml
  * Tasks should be verified before considered complete, when possible use a small python script (save to ./verify/task_<id>_<descriptor>.py). The script should be well commented as to what it does and why.
  * Always make sure system documentation is up to date with work just done! manuals go in ./man/*.yaml
  * NOTE: All spec files need to have consistent references to each other.  This needs to be verified whenever spec files are changed.
  **** You can create temporary files to assist with task completion but they should be removed when task is complete.  Use the files outlined here for project tracking. ****
  **** It is important to keep the repository clean of uneccessary files. ****
  **** Follow the task instructions closely and carefully.  Constrain work and scope to the task.  Return with questions if needed and confirm any extra work if it is outside the scope. ****
  **** ALWAYS COMMIT AND PUSH the repository after a task. ****
  
current:
  - task:
      - id: 0.1
      name: "Phase 0 preparation"
      goal: "Create tasks and tooling in preparation for phase 0 implementation."
      files:
        - "spec/spec.yaml"
        - "spec/master_todo.yaml"
        - "spec/*.yaml"
        - "log/task_0_0_notes.yaml"
      details:
        focus:
          - "Creation of tasks for phase 0, materials and tooling needed for LLM based generation."
        notes:
          - "Tools needed will provide means for searching specifications and other files so LLM's can be provided with scoped context for each step/task."
        steps:         
          - "Create python tool that can retrieve contextual excerpts from specifications, logs, todos.  It will take a simple query as input and output the relevant context as JSON structures with linking/references so the text and references can be reasoned over in a logical manner."
          - "Create a test script for the doc query script -> ./verify; run and log test."
          - "Build a set of LLM prompt files (markdown).  Place them in a new directory ./prompts/dev/prompt_<task_id>_<step_number>.md; These prompts will be used to complete phase 0, limit the scope of each prompt to a specific narrow task so the complexity is minimal, trivial tasks can be combined.  The prompts will need to be executed in order (<step_number>).  Instruct the LLM to use the query tool (provide commands to run in terminal) to build a context for each prompt with the relevant documentation."
          - "Create a new task or tasks (starting at 0.2) with the steps needed to implement phase 0, this should include a step for each LLM prompt that will need to be executed with the path to the prompt."
          
  - task:
      - id: 2.0
      name: "Expand and Check Domain Modeling & Vocabulary"
      goal: "Identify core domain concepts (nouns, verbs) and relationships in NL."
      files:
        - "spec/spec.yaml"
        - "spec/domain.yaml"
        - "spec/*.yaml"
      details:
        focus:
          - "Entities (User, Order, Invoice, Workflow, Task, etc.)."
          - "Relationships (owns, approves, contains, depends_on, etc.)."
        notes:
          - "develop mapping to data_models/types."
        steps:
          - "Review spec documents and determine details that need to be added for a complete domain model."
          - "If more information is needed update ./open_questions.yaml"
          - "New spec files can be created if appropriate.  Use verification script to verify new files are referenced correctly."
          

future: 
  - "add context re-ordering feature; prompt/responses in chat history can be re-ordered in the left side list, drag and drop and/or buttons move up/down.  Need a reset button as well."
  - "(LLM) crawl the spec files and look for inconsistencies and areas that need elaboration, create document of questions to be addressed."
  - "repository bootstrapping with node/fastapi"
