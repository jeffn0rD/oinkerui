title: oinkerui master todo list
description: |
  This is a master development todo list for human and machine interaction.
  
prompt_guidance: |
  Always follow these guidelines and update project documentation:
  **** When possible and practical use deterministic methods (python code) to accomplish tasks.  ****
  * When processing tasks always creae a brief summary of steps and actions in log/task_<id>_summary.yaml .
  * In the task_<id>_summary.yaml file always provide 'justification:' for each step/action.  It is important to track the decisions made and reasoning behind them.
  * If there are errors, inconsistencies, or inadequate information to accomplish all goals of a task append questions to ./open_questions.yaml
  * If the task is complete mark it complete by removing the task from the list in this document and appending it to ./log/tasks_completed.yaml
  * Tasks should be verified before considered complete, when possible use a small python script (save to ./verify/task_<id>_<descriptor>.py). The script should be well commented as to what it does and why.
  * Always make sure system documentation is up to date with work just done! manuals go in ./man/*.yaml
  * NOTE: All spec files need to have consistent references to each other.  This needs to be verified whenever spec files are changed.
  **** You can create temporary files to assist with task completion but they should be removed when task is complete.  Use the files outlined here for project tracking. ****
  **** It is important to keep the repository clean of uneccessary files. ****
  **** Follow the task instructions closely and carefully.  Constrain work and scope to the task.  Return with questions if needed and confirm any extra work if it is outside the scope. ****
  **** ALWAYS COMMIT AND PUSH the repository after a task. ****
  
current:
  - task:
    - id: 0.0
    name: "Add phase 0"
    goal: "Add a phase 0 to the main specification document (./spec/spec.yaml); it needs to outline any steps to prepare for phase 1 development."
    files:
      - "spec/*.yaml"
      - "man/system_manual.yaml"
      - "man/user_manual.yaml"
    details:
      steps:
        - "make a pass through the spec documents ./spec/*.yaml; note any inconsistencies or missing information -> ./log/task_0.0_notes.yaml"
        - "create a placeholder yaml files (system, user) in ./man/ for future system documentation, create an appropriate basic structure."
        - "add 'phase 0' phase to ./spec/spec.yaml before phase 1, keeping the current yaml structural pattern."
        - "review goals for next task (id 0.1) steps created in this task need to logically precede work for the next task." 
        - "add todo steps for phase 0.  These need to be concrete steps that will prepare for phase 1 development."
        - "one step needed will be to create the folder structure in preparation for node.js and fastapi framework."
        - "any questions and details needed to complete the specification for further development."
        - "Create a python script (./verify/check_spec_refs.py) to parse the specifications and check file references.  Create that now and test."
        
  - task: 
      - id: 0.1
      name: "Expand and Check Domain Modeling & Vocabulary"
      goal: "Identify core domain concepts (nouns, verbs) and relationships in NL."
      files:
        - "spec/spec.yaml"
        - "spec/domain.yaml"
        - "spec/*.yaml"
      details:
        focus:
          - "Entities (User, Order, Invoice, Workflow, Task, etc.)."
          - "Relationships (owns, approves, contains, depends_on, etc.)."
        notes:
          - "develop mapping to data_models/types."
        steps:
          - "Review spec documents and determine details that need to be added for a complete domain model."
          - "If more information is needed update ./open_questions.yaml"
          - "New spec files can be created if appropriate.  Use verification script to verify new files are referenced correctly."
          

future: 
  - "add context re-ordering feature; prompt/responses in chat history can be re-ordered in the left side list, drag and drop and/or buttons move up/down.  Need a reset button as well."
  - "(LLM) crawl the spec files and look for inconsistencies and areas that need elaboration, create document of questions to be addressed."
  - "repository bootstrapping with node/fastapi"
