prompt_guidance: 'Always follow these guidelines and update project documentation:

  **** ALWAYS PULL the repository before starting a task. ****

  **** When possible and practical use deterministic methods (python code) to accomplish tasks.  ****

  * When processing tasks always creae a brief summary of steps and actions in log/task_<id>_summary.yaml .

  * when processing a task review the last task notes (log/task_<id>_notes.yaml).  There may be information needed or remaining

  work that needs to be completed first.

  * In the task_<id>_summary.yaml file always provide ''''justification:'''' for each step/action.  It is important to track
  the

  decisions made and reasoning behind them.

  * If there are errors, inconsistencies, or inadequate information to accomplish all goals of a task append questions to

  ./open_questions.yaml

  * If the task is complete mark it complete by removing the task from the list in this document and appending it to ./log/tasks_completed.yaml

  * Tasks should be verified before considered complete, when possible use a small python script (save to ./verify/task_<id>_<descriptor>.py).

  The script should be well commented as to what it does and why.

  * Always make sure system documentation is up to date with work just done! manuals go in ./man/*.yaml

  * NOTE: All spec files need to have consistent references to each other.  This needs to be verified whenever spec files

  are changed.

  **** You can create temporary files to assist with task completion but they should be removed when task is complete.  Use

  the files outlined here for project tracking. ****

  **** It is important to keep the repository clean of uneccessary files. ****

  **** Follow the task instructions closely and carefully.  Constrain work and scope to the task.  Return with questions if

  needed and confirm any extra work if it is outside the scope. ****

  **** ALWAYS COMMIT AND PUSH the repository after a task. ****

current: []
future:
- add context re-ordering feature; prompt/responses in chat history can be re-ordered in the left side list, drag and drop
  and/or buttons move up/down.  Need a reset button as well.
- (LLM) crawl the spec files and look for inconsistencies and areas that need elaboration, create document of questions to
  be addressed.
- repository bootstrapping with node/fastapi
open_questions: []
