      The Local LLM Project Workbench is a local-first, project-oriented LLM
      application with hierarchical projects, chats, data entities, tools,
      workflows, and Git-backed versioning.
      
      Key components:
      - Svelte frontend (SPA)
      - Node.js/Fastify backend (primary API)
      - Python/FastAPI backend (tools and execution)
      - OpenRouter integration (LLM gateway)
      - Git-based project versioning
      - File-based data storage (Phase 1-3)
      - Supabase integration (Phase 4+)

      - Path constraints enforced
      - No authentication required
      
      Server deployment (Phase 4+):
      - Supabase authentication
      - Role-based access control
      - Shell access disabled by default
      - Strict path validation
